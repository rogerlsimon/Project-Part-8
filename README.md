# Project-Part-8

In order to test model, run test.py. All of the sub-models needed to run test.py are in the model folder. The folder contains the weights for the sub-models as well as the weights for the ensemble models. Test_indiv_model.py is the file needed in order to run a single individual model on a particular video. Trainstacked.py is the file needed in order to train sub-models and fit the logistic regression class to them.
